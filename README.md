# Overview
This project was a personal website to display some of the work that I have done over the course of my time in college as well as a little bit about me as a person. Currently, the website uses Foundation as its CSS framework for a responsive design. However, as there is a lot of custom CSS created by me already inside the project, I do not know if this will stay the case. It also does not have a Javascript framework yet which is something I do plan to add in the future. As of right now, I am working on adding some projects to the projects page and also will finish up the fun page. There are some things that I also plan to rework such as the landing page because I'm not satisfied at the moment with how it looks and would want it to be more dynamic.

In order to see the webpage, first clone the repository
```Git
git clone
