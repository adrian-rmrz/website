# Overview
This project was a personal website to display some of the work that I have done over the course of my time in college as well as a little bit about me as a person. Currently, the website uses Foundation as its CSS framework for a responsive design. However, as there is a lot of custom CSS created by me already inside the project, I do not know if this will stay the case. It also does not have a Javascript framework yet which is something I do plan to add in the future. As of right now, I am working on adding some projects to the projects page and also will finish up the fun page. There are some things that I also plan to rework such as the landing page because I'm not satisfied at the moment with how it looks and would want it to be more dynamic.

## How to view the webpage
In order to see the webpage:
- First clone the repository
```Git
git clone git@github.com:adrian-rmrz/website.git
```
- Next, `cd` into where the repository is located
- Run `npm install` to install the node packages
- Finally, run `node server.mjs` to start up the server, by default, the port will be `8000`

## index.html
The home or landing page of the site. Currently, the page just has a landscape picture of me and with a welcome message to the site. However, my plans for the future of this page are adding a parallax effect to the page, making it more dynamic. Thoughts of also making a loading page are also being considered.

## fun.html
This is a page showcasing some of the things that I enjoy doing/find interesting. Currently, the page hasn't been updated so it's quite bare bones. However, I do plan on adding more things to show and add more flair. I am currently working on a Javascript slideshow to showcase pictures not just in `fun.html` but other pages that have pictures.

## info.html
`info.html` is just a short blurb about me, my studies in college, how I came to do what I do, and what I hope to accomplish in the future. 

## project.html
This is a page that shows some of the projects that I am either working on or have worked on in the past. Like `fun.html`, it is currently a work in progress. As aforementioned, I am currently on implementing a slideshow in Javascript to show the pictures of the project. 

## resume.html
This is a page with my resume. It is also a work in progress and I plan on adding the rest of my experiences to the page.
